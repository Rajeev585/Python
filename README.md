`PEP 8` : `Python Enhancement Proposal` Guidelines and best practices for writing clean `Python code`

1. Easy to `read`, `code` and `learn`
2. `High level interpreted` programming language ( Executes codes line by line)
3. `Object oriented`: Object that holds the value and data type, the memory address is passed to the variable. 
4. `Dynamically` typed ( `Data type` of object is based on its `assigned value` | Object can change its data type dynamically )
5. Abundance of `libraries` ( Pandas, NumPy, SciPy ) and `frameworks` ( Django, Flask )
6. `Portable` and `flexible` ( Anaconda, Jupyter, Terminal, IDE, Text Editor, Google Colab )
7. `Open source` with vibrant `community` support ( Stack Overflow, Videos, Medium )
8. Rich `documentation` ( Python and all the libraries i.e. builtin and 3rd party modules, submodules )
9. `Modularity`: Working in seperate `modules`, helps to **focus** and make development easy and less error prone.
10. `Reusability` of codes, `modules`, `functions`, `methods` and `classes` 
11. `Applications`: Statistics, Data Science, ML, DL, AI, IOT, Web Development, Analytics, System Admin, Automations, etc.
12. The only drawback is execution speed is `low` as compared to `C`, `C++`, etc.
